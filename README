This probably goes against what shotwell want me to do, but it annoys me I can't
rearrange my date ordered photos on the filesystem to be by event. Where it annoys 
me most is when I want to show my photos on the xbox and then have to browse via file
system. This is a hack that will **COPY** the photos to another directory (on my
        windows machine in my case) that is sorted as EVENT_NAME/photos
