I want to re-organize my personal photo	 collection to be ordered by
eventy, with the (approximate) monthly date added to the directory
name:
    2020-12_Christmas
    2021-01_Birthday
    2021-01_NewYear
    ...

I use [Shotwell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell) to organize the
pho1tos itself, then use this script to copy the then sorted files to a
output directory with the desired subdirectory structure.

The script is forked from a [similar script](https://github.com/steprobe/Shotwell-Export-To-Events) by [Stephen Rogers](https://github.com/steprobe),
with the only addition that I added integration for the monthly string
in my version. All credits for the idea and implementaiton go to him,
obviously. 

Example:
    sw_export_to_event.py -i ~/.local/share/shotwelll/data/photo.db -d <output_directory>
